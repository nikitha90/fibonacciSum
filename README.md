# fibonacciSum
This app helps to calculate the sum of the fibonacci for the given number
#Feature
Provide an input value and the result of this app would be the sum of the fibonacci series
Ex: input = 4
value of fibonacci(4) = 3
sum of the fibonacci(4) = fib(0) + fib(1) + fib(2) + fib(3) + fib(4)
i.e 0+1+1+2+3 = 7
The output is 7.

#negative scenarios
Exception will be thrown when the input value is negative
and if the calculated sum is more than the maximum integer number
